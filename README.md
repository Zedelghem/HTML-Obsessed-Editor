# HTML-Obsessed
## A safe HTML editor for your proofreaders

 A tiny, incredibly simple tool to allow the non-technical members of your team to work directly on production files without risking any changes made to any code that matters. Works best used with GitHub Desktop. Requires only the browser to run. Can be served or used locally.

Attached in two forms: as a single file and as a folder with the HTML, CSS and JS stored separately (in /src).

Features:
1. Opens a local folder (e.g. a cloned GitHub repository)
2. Shows only .html files
2.5 Greys out all subfolders not containing any .html files.
3. Greys out all HTML markup to make the text between the tags easily discernible.
4. You can edit directly in the browser and save the changes.

Then it's just a commit & push with GitHub Desktop.
